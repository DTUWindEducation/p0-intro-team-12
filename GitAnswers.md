1.  What is the difference between git and GitLab?
Git is only used for version control where GitLab enables a team to work on the same project in a online repository.
 
2.  What is the difference between GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket?  
They are all cloud based git platforms. They have different pricing. GitHub is for sharing work on open source projects.
They are basically the same but owned by different companies.
 
3.  Why would I ever want to use git, but not GitLab?  
If you are working alone on a project and you don't want to use online services.
 
4.  What are the steps to update the GitLab server with some changes I made on my computer?  
Decide which codes are ready, use "git add" to tell that the files are ready. Use "git commit" to take a snapshot which uploades the code.
 
5.  What is a branch and why would I use one?
It is a version or a history of a project/code. It creates a parallel code so both the original and the branched code appears.
 
6.  How could you visualize a branch with 3 commits, and then another branch that breaks off after the second commit and has a single commit?

7.  Give an example of a set of git commands that would result in a merge conflict.  
In a scenario in which the branch you want to merge to the main one has missing files with respect to the main branch, rather than files you want to add.

8.  Is Git suitable for latex documents?
Yes, because latex is still plain text.

9.  Should I from now on version my word and powerpoint slides using git? Why/why not?  
Not suitable for git because it is not plain text, and it includes images etc.

10. What could happen when I push my latest commit to the remote repository without pulling first? 
If you have not pulled, you are risking to miss some changes done by colleagues before you started working.

11. What happens when I pull without commiting my local changes first?
You wouldn't be pulling the changes you have not comited.

12. What is the difference between branching and forking?
When branching, you are doing a copy of the repository in that same repository. But when forking, you are doing so in a completely new repository.
